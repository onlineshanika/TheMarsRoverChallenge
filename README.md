# Mars Rover Project
This project simulates a Mars rover moving on a plateau. The rover can move forward, turn left, or turn right based on a series of commands. The plateau is represented as a grid with a given width and height, and the rover's position is represented as an (x, y) coordinate and a compass direction (N, S, E, or W).

### Requirements
To run this project, you'll need Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.
https://www.java.com/en/download/

### Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine: <br>
https://github.com/onlineshanika/TheMarsRoverChallenge.git

Then, navigate to the TheMarsRoverChallenge directory and run the following command to compile the source code: <br>
javac *.java


This will compile all of the Java source files in the current directory.

### Running the Project
To run the project, use the following command:
java TheMarsRoverChallenge 

This will start the Mars Rover simulation. You'll be prompted to enter the width and height of the plateau, as well as the starting position and direction of the rover. Then, you can enter a series of commands to control the rover's movements.

### Example Input and Output
Here's an example input and output for the Mars Rover simulation:

Enter coordinate : 0 0 N <br>
Enter Movement commands : RMMM <br>




### Future Enhancements

There are many possible enhancements that could be made to the Mars Rover program. Here are a few examples:

1.Obstacle detection: The Rover could be equipped with sensors to detect obstacles in its path and either avoid them or stop and send a warning to the operator.

2.Autonomous operation: The Rover could be made to operate autonomously, with the ability to make decisions based on its surroundings and to plan its own path to a specified destination.

3.Increased mobility: The Rover's mobility could be increased with the addition of wheels or treads to traverse difficult terrain, or by adding the ability to climb or descend steep slopes.

4.Enhanced communication: The Rover could be equipped with more advanced communication systems to allow for real-time monitoring and control from a remote location.

5.Multiple Rovers: The program could be extended to control multiple Rovers at the same time, with each Rover having its own unique set of capabilities and operating in a different part of the Plateau.

6.Improved data collection: The Rover could be equipped with a suite of scientific instruments to collect data about the Martian environment, such as images, temperature readings, and chemical analyses.

7.Enhanced mapping: The Rover could be equipped with advanced mapping software and hardware to create more detailed and accurate maps of the Plateau.
